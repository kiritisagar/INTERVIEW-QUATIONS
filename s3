What is an S3 Lifecycle Policy?
An S3 Lifecycle Policy allows you to define actions to automatically transition objects to different storage classes or delete them after a specified period.

How can you secure data in S3?
You can secure data in S3 using bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, and by enabling encryption (server-side or client-side).

Explain the different storage classes in S3?
S3 Standard: General-purpose storage with high durability and availability.
S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access.
S3 One Zone-IA: For infrequently accessed data stored in a single availability zone.
S3 Glacier: Low-cost storage for archival data with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest-cost storage class for long-term archival data with retrieval times of 12 hours or more

What is the purpose of the S3 Transfer Acceleration feature?
S3 Transfer Acceleration uses the globally distributed edge locations of Amazon CloudFront to accelerate the upload of objects to S3.

How would you set up a static website using S3?
To set up a static website, you create an S3 bucket, upload your static content, enable static website hosting on the bucket, and set up the bucket policy to allow public read access.

What is Pre-Signed URL in S3?
A pre-signed URL is a URL that you can provide to your users to grant temporary access to a specific S3 object. The URL is signed with your credentials and is valid for a specified duration.

How do you replicate data across regions in S3?
You can use Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate objects from one S3 bucket to another in a different AWS region. This is useful for disaster recovery and data locality

What is S3 Object Lock, and how is it used?
S3 Object Lock is a feature that prevents an object from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. It is used for regulatory compliance and data protection, ensuring data immutability.

How do you set up cross-account access to an S3 bucket?
Use bucket policies and IAM roles to grant cross-account access. The bucket owner creates a bucket policy that grants the external account access, and the external account can assume an IAM role with permissions to access the bucket.

How does Amazon S3 handle object deletions?
S3 supports two types of deletions:
Simple Deletion: Deletes the object without maintaining any version history.
Versioned Deletion: If versioning is enabled, S3 adds a delete marker to the object, preserving previous versions.

What is the maximum size of an object that can be stored in Amazon S3?
The maximum size for a single object stored in Amazon S3 is 5 terabytes (TB).

How can you secure data stored in Amazon S3?
Data in Amazon S3 can be secured through:
Access Control: Using bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) to manage access permissions.
Encryption: Encrypting data at rest using server-side encryption (SSE) or client-side encryption before uploading.
IAM Policies: Defining IAM policies to control who can manage and access your S3 resources.
Access Logging: Enabling logging to track access requests to your S3 buckets.

How does Versioning work in Amazon S3?
Versioning allows you to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. It helps in protecting against accidental deletion or overwrites by retaining all versions of an object.

What are the limitations of Amazon S3?
Some limitations of Amazon S3 include:
Object size limit: Maximum size of a single object is 5 terabytes.
Bucket naming constraints: Bucket names must be globally unique and comply with DNS naming conventions.
Request rate limits: S3 has request rate limits that vary by operation type and are designed to protect the service from abuse.
